1. No Data Collection
Network Explorer does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). All operations and data analysis occur locally on your device. We do not have servers, and we do not want your data.

2. Information the App Uses
To perform its functions as a network utility, the app requires access to information about your device's network state. This includes:

Local Network Information: The app scans your local Wi-Fi network to discover and display information about other connected devices (like their local IP address, MAC address, and open ports). This information stays on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.
Bluetooth Device Information: The app scans for nearby Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices to display their names, signal strength, and other broadcasted characteristics. This scanning occurs only on your device.

3. Android Permissions
Network Explorer requests certain Android permissions to function correctly. Most permissions (such as location) are required by Android in order to discover networks and devices. Network Explorer does not actually attempt to determine your geographic location.

Network Explorer does not every attempt to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

Bluetooth permissions are requested in order to identify Bluetooth devices in the vicinity. Network Explorer does not request permissions need to actually connect to a Bluetooth device.

5. Third-Party Services
